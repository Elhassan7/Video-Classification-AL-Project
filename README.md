# VideoClassificationApp
The ultimate goal of this repository is to make a web app to deploy a video classification model, based on CNN and LSTM, using Streamlit.
To see how it works, you can check the following link : https://youtu.be/j1tdHsOmCng

Note : 
ffmpeg should be installed and added to the path variable so the python file app.py can be be executed successfully.

- **`Step 1:` Visualize the Data with its Labels**

- **`Step 2:` Preprocess the Dataset**

- **`Step 3:` Split the Data into Train and Test Set**

- **`Step 4:` Implement the ConvLSTM Approach**

    - **`Step 4.1:` Construct the Model**
    
    - **`Step 4.2:` Compile & Train the Model**
    
    - **`Step 4.3:` Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves**

- **`Step 5:` implement the LRCN Approach**
 
    - **`Step 5.1:` Construct the Model**
    
    - **`Step 5.2:` Compile & Train the Model**
    
    - **`Step 5.3:` Plot Model’s Loss & Accuracy Curves**
    
- **`Step 6:` Test the Best Performing Model on YouTube videos**

Alright, so without further ado, let's get started.
